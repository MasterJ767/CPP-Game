# CPP-Game
 
A simple C++ game inspired by Goat Simulator. You Control a goat who runs around a world destroying cubes, spheres and capsules to earn points. In this world there are a series of purple and pink doors which get toggled by buttons placed aroudn the world. The pink doors raise when the purple ones fall and vice versa. There are human enemies in the world who will run away fromt he player if the player gets too close or is seen. The aim is to collect the most spheres, capsules and cubes before the time runs out. Chasing a human into a cube, sphere or capsule will also collect that object for the player. 

At the start of this project I was given a renderer and a basic physics system which I had to build on top of by implementing collision detection, ray casting and simple state machines to create a game.
